landing-page
============

This is just the code of my personal landing page. It acts as a switch from my personal home page to my online profiles.

Demo
----
A demo (my home page) can be found [here](http://www.sebastianoergel.com).

Setup
-----
Make sure to have `less` and `coffee-script` installed, e.g. via `npm`.

Execute the `compile_assets.sh` from the shell. This should compile the `coffee` and the `less` assets.

Finally, just put all the files to your host of choice.

Icons
-----
The social media icons were taken from [simple-icons](https://github.com/danleech/simple-icons).
